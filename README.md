# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Hunt Event: TOR Usage

## üß† Executive Summary

**Objective:**  
Detect and confirm unauthorized installation or use of the TOR browser by an endpoint user in order to bypass corporate security policies.

**Scenario Overview:**  
Suspicious encrypted network activity and anonymous reports suggest potential TOR usage. This hunt aims to identify file, process, and network evidence related to TOR execution on a managed endpoint.

## üóÇÔ∏è Steps Taken by Threat Actor (Recreated)

1. Downloaded TOR browser installer to local machine  
2. Executed `tor.exe` from `Downloads` folder  
3. Connected to known TOR port 9050  
4. Maintained outbound TOR network traffic for 10‚Äì15 minutes

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

TOR usage was **confirmed** on the analyzed endpoint. Logs showed execution of `tor.exe` and verified network traffic to TOR nodes.

---

## üö® Response

- Device was isolated using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint  
- Evidence logs were archived for review  
- Relevant team notified for policy review and user follow-up  
- No persistent malware or lateral movement observed

---

## üîÑ Recommendations

- Implement application allow-listing  
- Monitor `DeviceNetworkEvents` for TOR port activity  
- Block known TOR IP ranges at the firewall  
- Conduct user awareness training on acceptable internet usage
